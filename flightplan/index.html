								<p>Delivering a quality guest experience is one thing but delivering it on every call with informed data to your agents is something all on its own. BluIP should be prepared to bridge the current gap between the call and guest information so that agents are prepared with caller information. This should benefit the CEC and increase channel engagement.</p>

					<p>Inconsistent experiences create inconsistent guests. Developing a consistent telephony strategy both at answer and at transfer are simple ways to connect with your guests while gaining insight into call path.</p>
					<p>Money, Cost, Bottom line. They are all one and they are all being impacted when using a toll-free number to transfer calls. Replace these numbers with a local number to shift your cost to revenue.</p>
					<p>This shift allows for faster implementation of technology and innovation.</p>

					<p>These are carried into greetings for the CEC and transfer messaging. Make these systemic in nature without a robotic approach so that each call is relayed the right way every time.</p>
					<p>BluIP isn’t just technology. We’re also a Tier 1 cloud communications provider and carrier. We will transition those old numbers to new ones that remove the toll charges.</p>
					<p>We do all the heavy lifting so you can focus on your guests.</p>

						<li><p>Your loyalty guests expect you to know who they are when they call.</p></li>
						<li><p>By proactively prompting guests with key points, collaborative trust is initiated.</p></li>
						<li><p>Demand is down which means the race to answer every guest call, inquiry and concern is more important than ever. MI needs omni channel capabilities with the ability to seamlessly respond, answer or transition a caller to a live agent from any site, any time.</p></li>

					<p>Imagine a world where no matter the channel, you can:</p>

						<li><p>Lookup guest profile data</p></li>
						<li><p>Prompt the guest with the information and deliver a personal experience</p></li>
						<li><p>Make strategic recommendations based on historical data</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>All with a Virtual Agent and all within reach</p>
					<p>Now, imagine this guest wants to talk with a live agent:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Transition the guest to an agent while articulating that experience into rich data</p></li>
						<li><p>Combine the interactions so that the live agent is prepared with the caller’s needs</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>How BluIP does this:</strong></p>
					<p>Work from the end – the identified marker of success. We’ve identified a gap in business which tells us call information and delivery is inconsistent and that Bonvoy callers aren’t prompted as they could be.</p>

					<p>Because guests need and want more with every interaction and you have the ability to deliver the unexpected. Anyone can answer a phone, but you can make it unique.</p>
					<p>Because anticipating the next move isn’t just for sports anymore. With the right technology and integrations, you can anticipate and proactively connect.</p>
					<p>Because guests shouldn’t have to give you multiple points of information when you can find their profile and reservations when the phone rings.</p>

					<p>BluIP’s flight plan is based on the CEC call volume data provided in the RFP. Understanding the data, call volume and traffic, we have created the assumptive analysis below which identifies targets, means and optimal benchmarks.</p>
					<p><strong>FACTS:</strong> Historical volume indicates consistent growth between 2016-2018 with an assumed steady state in 2019. This volume decreases in 2020 at -59% YOY when applying a monthly calculation.</p>
					<p><strong>UNKNOWN:</strong> Will volume stabilize at the current -59%, continue to trend downward or will there be achieved growth in 2021?</p>
					<p><strong>HOW TO PROCEED:</strong> BluIP should assume that call volume will stabilize at current levels but marginally increase within 6-9 months, based on forecasted market trends by both STR and other recovered markets.</p>
					<p><strong>WHY THIS MATTERS:</strong> BluIP has proposed a plan which addresses cost without revenue return {1}, increased Bonvoy adoptions and introduction of an IVA {2} and implement a long-term AIVA strategy {3}.</p>
					<p>The data and projections below are variable based on the assumptions made to create a calculation:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Average Handle Time (AHT) was the same in all categories</p></li>
						<li><p>Average monthly volume was used due to partial volume in 2020. This was achieved by dividing all calls and minutes by the number of months measured, then multiplying by 12. 2020, 9 months were used.</p></li>
						<li><p>AIVA can be applied to all call types but recommended to phase in and allow for each stakeholder to understand, measure and qualify success. As a sample, AIVA is applied to non-revenue calls as a solution while still fronting the interaction for all other call types.</p></li>
						<li><p>Regardless of the outcome, it should be understood that AIVA is expected to reduce AHT if a caller engages the process.</p></li>
